## Smart House (Project Under Construction)

Home Assistant allows you to control all your devices without storing any of your data in the cloud. Its an home automation hub where different devices with different protocols communicate with each other. This means you can link all your devices in just one place and build cool automations based on the state of all your devices.

There are different ways to install Home Assistant. You can run it on your computer or use a Raspberry Pi to act as an exclusive home automation hub

We have attempted to connect multiple devices and sensors
